# Feature-Sliced Design ("FSD") Example with Sveltekit

This is a dummy project I use for a blog post. In the post I cover how I set up FSD layers to maximum productivity.


## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
